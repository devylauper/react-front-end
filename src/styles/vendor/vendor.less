/*
    [HACK]: For the UI Framework ANT.DESIGN, because its written in .less but 
    the base of this website is written in .sass, we need to work around the issue. 
    So we created this file which imports the main stylesheet and we overwrite the 
    variables at the end to our new variables, ultimately themeing out ANT.DESIGN.
    The two theme stylesheets you will be referencing are listed below:

    https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme
    https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/color/colors.less
    https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less

    Copy and paste over the Variables from the above links into vendor-vars-overwrites.less file as you need them, 
    alternatively copy and paste everything and do a full overwrite.
